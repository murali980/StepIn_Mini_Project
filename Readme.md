## Introduction
Employee Management System is an application, developed to maintain the details of employees working in any  organization. It maintains the information about the personal details of their employees. The application is actually a suite of applications developed using C. It is simple to understand and can be used by anyone who is not even familiar with simple employees system. It is user friendly and just asks the user to follow step by step operations by giving him few options. It is fast and can perform many operations of a company.

I had taken this code as reference from github and i had made some modification by adding some functions and adding more details about the employee and divided the functions for multiple files.
